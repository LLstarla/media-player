00:00:17 --> 00:00:23
[You drift off with the current]

1
00:00:23 --> 00:00:29
[Along the river of memory]

2
00:00:29 --> 00:00:34
[And running along the bank]

3
00:00:34 --> 00:00:41
[I shout to you to come back]

4
00:00:41 --> 00:00:47
[But slowly, you slip away]

5
00:00:47 --> 00:00:54
[And in my desperate course]

6
00:00:54 --> 00:01:00
[Little by little, I recover]

7
00:01:00 --> 00:01:07
[Some of the lost ground]

8
00:01:07 --> 00:01:13
[From time to time, you sink]

9
00:01:13 --> 00:01:19
[Into the moving liquid]

10
00:01:19 --> 00:01:25
[Or brushing past some brambles]

11
00:01:25 --> 00:01:31
[You hesitate and wait for me]

12
00:01:31 --> 00:01:37
[Hiding your face]

13
00:01:37 --> 00:01:44
[Inside your upturned dress]

14
00:01:44 --> 00:01:50
[For fear of being disfigured]

15
00:01:50 --> 00:01:56
[By shame and by regrets]

16
00:01:56 --> 00:02:02
[You're now but a poor wreck]

17
00:02:02 --> 00:02:08
[Carrion floating by]

18
00:02:08 --> 00:02:14
[But I remain your slave]

19
00:02:14 --> 00:02:21
[And I dive into the stream]

20
00:02:21 --> 00:02:27
[When the memory stops]

21
00:02:27 --> 00:02:33
[And the ocean of forgetfulness]

22
00:02:33 --> 00:02:40
[Breaking our hearts and our heads]

23
00:02:40 --> 00:02:51
[Forever makes us one again]
